### Grid Indexer Technical Test

This project contains a partly completed solution for building a Web API that can
return the x and y coordinates of a grid index or the letter/number index of a grid coordinate.

The purpose of this exercise is to see how you solve the described problem and how you
test your solution.

For this exercise:

1) Clone this repository and create your own branch
2) Implment the grid indexer to convert a string index in the form of 
"A2, A2... E5" to a grid coordinate - e.g A1 becomes X=0, Y=0
3) Implement the reverse of what is described in task 1, converting a grid coordinate
to a string index - e.g. X=0, Y=1 becomes A1
4) Unit test your work with the goal of 100% test coverage
